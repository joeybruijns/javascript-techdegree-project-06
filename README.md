# Static Node.js and Express Project Site
### Full-Stack Javascript Techdegree | Project 06

This project is part of the Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree program. In this project, we'll create a portfolio site to showcase the projects we've built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page with contact info, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least the first five projects from this Techdegree.
